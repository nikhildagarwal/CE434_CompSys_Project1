In this file we have handfiltered the outputs for the keys that were found.
Because in our bfs algo the keys are found and reported in their specific processes, we show that each process is only reporting one key.

As we can see the program now only prints the first key that was found in every process that had keys.
If a process did not have any keys it is ignored. The code above was run for PN = 43 processes.
From the return args we can see that child 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8 found keys and so on.
